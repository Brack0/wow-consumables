        <h2>A bit of role play</h2>
        <p>There are four types of consumables for raiding (flasks, food, potions and runes. Most of the guild will ask you
          to have at least flask and food. Runes are not craftable, food is obtainable by everyone (with cooking profession,
          and affordable at the auction house), flasks and potions require to be alchemist (not everyone can craft them and
          they are expensive to buy). The app should help people to plan orders to their favorite alchemist and cooker.</p>

        <h2>Alchemy</h2>
        <p>Alchemists turn various reagents (mostly Herbs) into powerful consumables that fall under one of the three categories
          : Elixirs, Flasks and Potions.</p>
        <p>Aside from combat-oriented brews, alchemists can also perform ore and gem transmutes.</p>

        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>Cooking is a secondary profession which allows players to combine various ingredients such as fish or meat into delicious
          food and drink items which can be consumed to restore health and mana, as well as to grant combat buffs. This skill
          is often paired with Fishing, since leveling the latter often provides the materials needed for Cooking.</p>
